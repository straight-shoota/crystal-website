In the US, it takes on average 7.6 years to reach a rare disease diagnosis. Patients often receive 2 to 3 wrong diagnoses before the correct one, and the majority of patients actually remains undiagnosed.

A key reason for the slow diagnostic process is that genome interpretation still is a highly manual process. A geneticist would manually review thousands of variants, trying to find the one causal mutation, similar to searching for a needle in a haystack. Even with specialised software, the average genetic center in the US is currently spending about 20 to 40 hours interpreting the patient’s genome. This manual approach does not scale in an era of personalised medicine.

With Moon, we've developed the first software system that goes from genetic data to a provisional diagnosis in just a few minutes, saving hours or even days per patient — time that might be critical to the patient’s survival.

In this talk, we explore how Crystal contributes to genome diagnostics at Invitae, allowing us to give patients answers faster.
We show how Crystal's syntax, type system and performance offer a unique edge compared to other, more popular programming languages.",

Within a few clicks, I went from my beautiful editor environment with formatting, linting, and syntax highlighting to a barren wasteland of open and close HTML tags, embedded ""<%= %>"" strewn everywhere, and an inability to use any of the great tools I had in the language like classes, structs, and functions easily.

Then, I found Lucky. Everything is Crystal, even the HTML, which meant that all of my pain points were gone. Within a few days of working with the framework, a weight I didn't even know I'd been carrying had vanished and I was as productive and confident in my markup as I was in the rest of my codebase.

This talk would expand upon the most-viewed LuckyCast I've ever created (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4WfMuhsHZg), and hopefully encourage any Crystal developers who are still writing web applications in other large frameworks to give Crystal (and Lucky) a chance!  ",

Sort of like the previous conference, I'd like to see what I can present that could fit in well in terms of scope / audience. Are we looking for more success stories? More technical entries giving a 'how to'? More 'future of ___ in Crystal'? I'd like to think I can provide something to help round things out.

I would really like to promote the idea that object-oriented design principles are under-utilized in the sciences. I believe that Crystal really strikes that perfect balance that the sciences need today between dynamic and performant. It's a shame that too few scientists are taught to reason about code abstractly in the same way as mathematical formulas but I think Crystal can change that.

I think some concrete examples of problems to solve in technical arenas and how those lead to programming challenges can be a nice way to demonstrate what it is exactly about Crystal that should attract scientists. (I don't quite feel qualified to really analyze this, but I believe there is a strong argument to be made wrt the adoption and popularity of a language and its scientific frameworks).

These could be drawn from:
1. My Ph.D. work in theoretical physics: briefly highlighted at the previous Crystal conference.
2. My later work translating scientific command-line applications to Javascript (physics modeling ranging from asteroids and dark matter to plasmas and cold fusion): I can give concrete examples of (anti-)patterns in those scientific applications and how Crystal points out a better way.
3. My current role as a software engineer at the quantum computing startup IonQ. If there's strong interest here, I'd work with our PR people to share as much as I can behind the scenes of some of the problems we're working on and how they could be addressed with the kinds of tools that Crystal brings to the table.

So if you're interested, let's talk about what you feel hasn't been submitted to the conference yet or which of the above seems most interesting to conference organizers!",
17:00-Nicolas Ganz: Performance Evaluation of Crystal,nicolas.jpeg (https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/b6a93312c40bc6e80fb38069e1a657fb/1d0aa4ba/nicolas.jpeg),Performance,17:00,17:15,Short Talk,15,Track 1,Performance Evaluation of Crystal,Nicolas Ganz,"Crystal tries to combine the simplicity to write software of Ruby with the performance of C. This presentation aims to show performance comparisons of Crystal with the programming languages Ruby, C and Go.

This is done by using different example programs that use specific parts used in real world applications. Those include iterative and recursive implementations of the Fibonacci sequence, reading and writing files, listening to sockets, as well as calling a method written in C.

The results show that Crystal can be considered a fast programming language. While C with all optimisations of gcc is still faster, the performance of Crystal is comparable with Go. As expected is Ruby, with just-in-time (JIT) compilation or without, by a factor of 8 respectively 9 slower than Crystal.",

As programs grow in scale and complexity, ensuring compliance with the overall design intent becomes more critical yet also more difficult. The goal of the Wyvern programming language is to help programmers cleanly express and enforce design as an integral part of programming. Wyvern accomplishes this with a capability-safe object model that expresses design constraints constructively, a strong system of types and effects to enforce abstractions at both component and object scales, and an extensible syntax that can express designs in a variety of domains while preserving important security and modularity properties. The talk will flesh out these design goals and demonstrate how the features of the language support them, while highlighting some research directions that have arisen from the language's goals.",http://wyvernlang.github.io/

Not only that, it is also the least documented, and the most complex topic in the language. This talk is in some way a continuation and a further development of Ary Borenszweig's 'Simple macros, powerful macros' talk at Øredev 2016. Whilst Ary's talk is amazingly concise and explains the subject in great detail with concrete examples of macro usage, the crystal-lang language, community, and the shard ecosystem have evolved significantly over the past five years. Hence a more up-to-date presentation seems necessary. More importantly, I would like to explore the organic development of macro usage in the crystal-lang community, especially as demonstrated in some of the most successful shards (web frameworks, ORMs, serializers).

One thing I sorely missed, though, was the massive ecosystem I’d left behind with Ruby and Rails. Specifically, the ability to quickly add and remove functionality from my apps with the incredible RailsBytes.com site built by Chris Oliver at GoRails.

My first instinct was to think “Okay, how do I rebuild this entire thing in Crystal!?”. That task started seeming impossible as a Crystal newbie, so I went back to what I knew. 30 minutes later, I’d created the Bloat gem, which provided an easy way to apply RailsBytes anywhere, including Lucky apps! Since then, I’ve used these RailsBytes to make short and sweet LuckyCasts, as well as to help new folks to Lucky get up and running quickly with the tools they know and love from their previous language/framework.

This talk would attempt to destroy the “Ruby vs Crystal” wall that is prone to develop by demonstrating how easily a problem in our community was solved by leveraging existing community tools in another language.",
